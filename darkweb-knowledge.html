                        <p>Most people only experience the tip of the internet iceberg, unaware that the vast majority of online content exists beneath the surface in the deep and dark webs.

                        <p>The surface web (also called the open web or clearnet) represents the portion of the internet that is indexed by search engines like Google and accessible through standard web browsers. This is the internet most people use daily.</p>

                        <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Surface Web Characteristics</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Indexed content:</strong> Pages are cataloged by search engine crawlers </li>
                            <li><strong>Easy accessibility:</strong> No special software or credentials required</li>
                            <li><strong>Familiar domains:</strong> Uses standard domains like .com, .org, .gov, .edu </li>

                        <div class="code-block">
# Surface Web Examples

- News websites (BBC, CNN)
- Social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter)
- E-commerce sites (Amazon, eBay)
- Company websites and blogs
- Wikipedia and other public knowledge bases
- YouTube and streaming platforms

                        <p>Contrary to popular misconception, the deep web is not inherently dangerous or illegal. It simply refers to any online content not indexed by traditional search engines, most of which is legitimate and used by people every day.</p>

                        <h3 class="h5 mt-4">What Makes Content "Deep Web"?</h3>
                        <p>Deep web content exists behind security walls, authentication forms, and passwords that prevent search engines from accessing it. This protection is typically for privacy and security reasons, not concealment of illicit activities.</p>

                        <p>The dark web is a small, intentionally hidden part of the deep web that requires specific software, configurations, or authorization to access. It was originally developed for legitimate purposes but has gained notoriety for illegal applications.</p>

                        <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Origins and History</h3>
                        <p>The groundwork for the dark web began in 2000 with Freenet, a University of Edinburgh student thesis project aimed at creating a "Distributed Decentralised Information Storage and Retrieval System." This evolved into the Tor Project, released in 2002, with a browser launching in 2008.</p>

# Dark Web Timeline

2000 - Freenet launched as academic project
2002 - Tor Project released
2008 - Tor Browser launched
2011 - Infamous Silk Road marketplace emerged
2013 - Silk Road shut down by authorities
Present - Ongoing legitimate and illicit uses

                        <h3 class="h5 mt-4">How the Dark Web Works</h3>
                        <p>The dark web uses "onion routing" technology that protects users from surveillance through a random path of encrypted servers. When users access a site through Tor, their information routes through thousands of relay points, making browsing virtually impossible to trace.</p>

                        <div class="dark-web-diagram">
                            <h5 class="text-center mb-3">Onion Routing Process</h5>
                            <div class="code-block bg-dark text-light">
1. User data encrypted multiple times (like onion layers)
2. Enters Tor network through entry node
3. Passes through multiple relay nodes
4. Each node decrypts one layer of encryption
5. Final node (exit node) sends data to destination
6. Destination sees only exit node, not original user

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Whistleblowing:</strong> Secure communication for journalists and sources</li>

                        <p>The deep web and dark web represent the vast, hidden portions of the internet that few users fully understand. While the deep web is mostly benign and contains our private digital lives, the dark web presents both opportunities for privacy and threats from criminal elements.</p>

                        <div class="code-block">
# Key Takeaways

- Surface web: ~5% of internet, publicly accessible content
- Deep web: ~90% of internet, private but legitimate content
- Dark web: Small portion of deep web, requires special access
- Dark web has legitimate privacy uses but also illegal activities
- Access requires extreme security precautions
- Your information may be on dark web without your knowledge
                        </div>

                        <p>Understanding these distinctions helps demystify the hidden internet while emphasizing the importance of cybersecurity. For most users, the deep web is part of daily digital life, while the dark web should be approached with extreme caution or avoided entirely unless absolutely necessary.</p>

                        <div class="warning-box">
                            <strong>Final Recommendation:</strong> Unless you have specific, legitimate needs for anonymity that outweigh the significant risks, it's safest to avoid the dark web entirely. Focus instead on protecting your personal information and practicing good cybersecurity habits in your everyday internet use.
