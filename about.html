            <li>
                <ul>My journey into the world of hacking and cybersecurity was greatly inspired by the Anonymous group.
                    Their <br>
                    activities and impact on the digital landscape sparked my curiosity and motivated me to delve deeper
                    <br>
                    into this field.

        </p>
        <p>
            <li>
                <ul> The Anonymous collective, known for their high-profile cyber operations and activism, demonstrated
                    <br>
                    the power of technical skills when applied to social and political causes. Their ability to expose
                    <br>
                    vulnerabilities in seemingly secure systems and their commitment to freedom of information resonated
                    with me

        <p>
            <li>
                <ul>While I don't condone all of their methods, the Anonymous group opened my eyes to the significant
                    <br>
                    influence that skilled hackers can have on the world. This realization drove me to pursue ethical
                    hacking<br>
                    and cybersecurity, aiming to use my skills to protect and improve digital systems rather than
                    exploit them.

             <ul>Inspired by their technical prowess and the concept of hacktivism, I decided to channel my passion <br>
            into a positive direction. I committed myself to learning the intricacies of cybersecurity, with the <br>
            goal of becoming an ethical hacker who contributes to a safer digital environment for all.
