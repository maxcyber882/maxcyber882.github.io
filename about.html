                Hey I'm Mayank you might know me as (Max Cyber) , an Ethical Hacker and Bug Bounty Hunter passionate about cybersecurity and
                all things hacking. Currently, I work full-time as a Cybersecurity Engineer, where I help safeguard
                organizations from cyber threats and vulnerabilities. My work allows me to dive deep into security
                practices, analyze risks, and ensure robust defenses are in place.

        <div class="hack mt-4">
            <p>Beyond my full-time job, I’m always expanding my knowledge and honing my skills in various fields, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Malware Analysis - Understanding how malicious software operates, identifying its behavior, and finding ways to neutralize it.</li>
                <li>Digital Forensics – Investigating cyber incidents and uncovering digital evidence to solve complex cybercrimes.</li>
                <li>Reverse Engineering – Breaking down programs and systems to understand their inner workings, which is essential for identifying vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>Programming – Mastering programming languages and tools that help me create exploits, automate tasks, and understand application logic at a deeper level.</li>
                <li>Advanced Web Security – Exploring web application vulnerabilities, from OWASP Top 10 to advanced bypass techniques, and developing a solid understanding of how to secure web applications effectively.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="mayank mt-4">
            <p>My ultimate goal is to become a professional hacker, mastering advanced techniques and helping to make the digital world a safer place. I'm driven by curiosity, and every day I strive to learn new skills and push my limits.</p>
            <p>When I’m not working or learning, I’m actively involved in bug bounty programs, finding vulnerabilities and contributing to a more secure online environment.</p>
            <p>My journey into the world of hacking and cybersecurity was greatly inspired by the Anonymous group. Their activities and impact on the digital landscape sparked my curiosity and motivated me to delve deeper into this field.</p>
            <p>The Anonymous collective, known for their high-profile cyber operations and activism, demonstrated the power of technical skills when applied to social and political causes. Their ability to expose vulnerabilities in seemingly secure systems and their commitment to freedom of information resonated with me.</p>
            <p>While I don't condone all of their methods, the Anonymous group opened my eyes to the significant influence that skilled hackers can have on the world. This realization drove me to pursue ethical hacking and cybersecurity, aiming to use my skills to protect and improve digital systems rather than exploit them.</p>
            <p>Inspired by their technical prowess and the concept of hacktivism, I decided to channel my passion into a positive direction. I committed myself to learning the intricacies of cybersecurity, with the goal of becoming an ethical hacker who contributes to a safer digital environment for all.</p>
