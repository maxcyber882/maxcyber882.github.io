                        <p>The internet is a massive global network of connected computers and devices that communicate using standardized rules. Think of it as the world's largest postal system, but instead of sending letters, we send digital information at incredible speeds.</p>
                        
                        <div class="myth-truth-box">
                            <strong>Myth Buster:</strong> The internet is NOT produced in factories or generated like electricity. It's a communication network that exists because devices worldwide are connected and following the same rules.

                        <p>At its core, the internet is:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <p>Despite being called the "world wide web," the internet has a very physical presence made of actual cables and equipment that span the entire globe.</p>

                        <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Undersea Cables</h3>
                        <p>Massive fiber-optic cables run along ocean floors, connecting continents. These cables carry internet traffic between countries and are essential for global connectivity.</p>

                        <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Land-Based Infrastructure</h3>
                        <p>On land, the internet travels through various physical mediums:</p>
                        
                        <div class="code-block">
// Physical Connection Types

- Fiber optic cables: Glass strands carrying light signals
- Copper wires: Traditional telephone and cable lines
- Cellular towers: Wireless connections for mobile devices
- Satellite links: For remote areas without cables
- WiFi routers: Local wireless connections

                        <h2 class="h4 fw-bold mb-3">How Information Travels: Packets and Protocols</h2>
                        <p>When you send information over the internet, it doesn't travel as one continuous stream. Instead, it's broken into small pieces called "packets" that follow specific rules.</p>

                        <h3 class="h5 mt-4">The Packet System</h3>
                        <p>Data is broken into packets that travel independently through the network and are reassembled at the destination.</p>

// Data Packet Structure
+-----------------------------------+
| Header                            |

                        <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Internet Protocols (TCP/IP)</h3>
                        <p>Protocols are the rules that govern how devices communicate. TCP/IP ensures reliable data delivery across the network.</p>

                        <div class="code-block">
// Protocol Operation

1. Your device breaks data into packets
2. Each packet gets destination IP address
3. Packets travel independently through network
4. Routers direct packets toward destination
5. Receiving device reassembles packets
6. Missing packets are requested again

                        <p>The incredible speed of the internet comes from several engineering marvels working together.</p>

                        <h3 class="h5 mt-4">1. Light-Speed Communication</h3>
                        <p>Fiber optic cables use light to transmit data, traveling at 299,792 kilometers per second.</p>

                        <div class="code-block">
// Speed Reality Check

- New York to London: 5,585 km
- Light travel time: 0.018 seconds
- Actual internet travel: ~0.06 seconds
